# Fall Camping Web App! (FCWebApp)
organize :D

Most data gets pulled from Profiles / FreeIPA  
Ride data is with Rideboard  
Some data is specific to here (notably emergency contacts and allergies)  
All data from not CSH auth also needs to go here

### Build the guy
`python -m venv .venv`  
`source .venv\bin\activate`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Set the env
`cp .env.example .env`

### Run the guy
`docker compose up --watch --build`

## Navbar
This should have "TIME TIL FALL CAMPING" which counts down to when the rideboard is started.

## Sleeping Board
✔️ Holds all tents and hammocks, along with who is residing in which  
✔️ Users can create tents and hammocks  
✔️ And name it!! very important  
Also holds who needs tent

## Rideboard Integration
Will aggressively notify you if you are NOT in a ride but are in sleeping board (and vice versa)  
Needs giant modal at the top of every friggin page (probably part of the imports)

## Profile page
Needs ALL the data if provider is Google auth.  Otherwise, only minimal emergency data.  
It will display info from Profiles read-only, with a link to go edit it there.  
Mandatory fields will be marked as red, and will display a modal on every page until all data is verified.

## Admin Panel
Lets you link to a Rideboard - this pulls the fall camping date  
Holds "hitlist" for people who don't meet the requirements
